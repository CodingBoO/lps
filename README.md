Code for the paper ``Learning to Promote Saliency Detectors"

In my experiment, I argumented the training data before training. I'll add data argumentation on the the fly later.
## Usage
* first, install [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
* modify the prior map, input and output directory in ```test_once.py```, ```test_iterative.py```, and ```train.py```
* to download and use my trained model, run ```test_once.py``` or ```test_iterative.py```
* to train a new model, run ```train.py```
